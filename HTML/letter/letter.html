<h3> RE: Eileen Dover university application</h3>
<p>Dear Eileen,</p>
<p>Thank you for your recent application to join at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your question one by one, in the follows:</p>
<h3>Staring date </h3>
<p>We are happy accomdate your staring you study with us as any time</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Fist semester: 9 September 2016</p></li>
	<li><p>Second semester: 15 January 2017</p></li>
	<li><p>Third semester: 2 May 2017</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please le me know if this ok, and if so start date you would prefer </p>
<p>You can find more information about <a href="">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>
<h3>Subjects of study</h3>
<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded reseach facility - as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of sicence and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researched, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>0<sub>3</sub>)</p></li>
	<li><p>Measuring the effect in prefromance of funk bassplayers at tempratures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>o</sup>F), whe the audience size exponentially increases  (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>)</p> </li>
	<li><p>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So please can you provide more information in each of these subject, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thank.</p>
<h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my host-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
<dl>
	<dt><p>Polynesian chicken dance</p></dt>
	<dd><p>A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruiful".</p></dd>
	<dt><p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p></dt>
	<dd><p>Before the Icelander developed fire as a mean of getting warm, they used to pratice this dance, which involver huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired moderm styles such as Twerking</p></dd>
	<dt><p>Arctic robot dance </p></dt>
	<dd><p>An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that thay were just moving like this because they were really cold.</p></dd>

<p>Yours sincerely.</p>
